All UI designs must be beautiful, simple, and elegant, using a monotone aesthetic inspired by Attio, Notion, and Apple software.

Do not use default text fields or buttons. All buttons must follow our custom minimal design system and meet these criteria:
  • Colorless or monotone with high contrast.
  • Rounded corners with smooth, subtle radii.
  • Soft, subtle shadows for depth without drawing attention.
  • No gradients, borders, or excessive styling.
  • Maintain visual harmony with surrounding elements.

Icons must be large, simple, and high-contrast. Never use cluttered or jumbled SVGs. Icons should:
	•	Be pixel-perfect and visually balanced.
	•	Use clean paths with minimal anchor points.
	•	Avoid unnecessary details, overlapping shapes, or noise.
	•	Be immediately recognizable at small sizes.
	•	Follow accessibility best practices.

Use hover effects wherever you can.

Always make everything mobile friendly.
